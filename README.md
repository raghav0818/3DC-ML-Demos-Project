## 🔌 API Reference

### useComputerVision Hook

Custom React hook that manages computer vision processing.

```typescript
const { isLoading, error, fps } = useComputerVision({
  mode: CVMode,           // 'clown-nose' | 'rock-paper' | 'victory'
  videoElement: HTMLVideoElement | null,
  canvasElement: HTMLCanvasElement | null,
  enabled: boolean
});
```

**Parameters:**
- `mode` - Current CV mode to run
- `videoElement` - Reference to video element
- `canvasElement` - Canvas for drawing overlays
- `enabled` - Whether processing is active

**Returns:**
- `isLoading` - Loading state for AI models
- `error` - Error message if any
- `fps` - Current frames per second

## 🧪 Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run start    # Start production server
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

### Adding a New CV Mode

1. Add the mode type to `types/cv.ts`
2. Implement detection logic in `useComputerVision.ts`
3. Update UI in `app/page.tsx`
4. Add instructions in the side panel
